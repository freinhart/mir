I sing a song
come on and sing along
that is what I want
that you sing my
little song

And you, you admit
that this song, this song is
nice to sing,
drives and swings
Ohuoh

My little song, this is
my little song

I wrote this song
and you, you sing along
The rhythm is fine
and the melody is mine
Ohuoh (please try)

And I, I bed you
to buy my records to
play them loud,
to scream and shout
out loud.
