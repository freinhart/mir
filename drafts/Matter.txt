I just wanna be alone,
so please leave me, come on
I know to you it might sound strange,
but I lust wanna lay in my bed.

I don't care what you think of me.
It doesn't matter at all.
I don't care what you think of me.
It doesn't matter, no, no.
It doesn't matter waht you think of me
and I don't care no more.

I can't stand it anymore,
that life is still what you ignore.
But I won't give up my desire
to set your world on fire.
