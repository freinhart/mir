I respect your values,
but who does if I wouldn`t?
So think about your decissions
to fit the world`s peace-mission.
I want to change the world,
but who does if I couldn`t?
So please use the opportunity
you have to build up a peaceful unity.
That freedom becomes reality
and everybody can live free.

I came here from Europe.
A long time haven`t seen you.
But I came here to be, to be so free.
So let me tell you a story:
the dream of love and harmony,
but disappointing reality
makes the American Dream to history.
makes the AD to history.

lost dreams of love
lost dreams of a healthy world
full of love and harmony

Who lost this mankind vision

lost dreams of real freedom
freedom for everyone

Who stil fight for our dreams
 for existantial visions?

lost dreams of a justice world
lost dreams of save peace



detrominate in your mind?

Intro:

.....lost dreams of love
.....lost dreams of real freedom
freedom for everyone
....lost dreams of a justice world
....lost dreams of save peace

Strophe I:

what is left of the american dream?
a nation which ever fighted,
In the past, for democracy
against war and slavery
But know there grow up fellings
america flight for his own
People died cause of oil
and power of warcompanies


Refrain:

lost dreams of a healthy world
full of love and harmony

lost dreams of a healthy world
full of peace and charity

lost dreams of a healthy world
full of justic and equality
