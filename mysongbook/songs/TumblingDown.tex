Intro: A, C#min, F#min, D

Verse 1:
A                   C#min
I see the sunlight, I see the rain
F#min                           D
I feel the river flow like it's running through my veins
A                             C#min
There is a fire it's burning, and I feel this pain
F#min                                      D
There's a storm alive in the sky till now, and we won't ever be the same

Bridge:
E                             D
There's nowhere left to hide  Your pretty face
E                       D
It's making a move for every place

Chorus:
A                  C#min
Tonight we'll leave
                F#min
I guess that's how it's got to be
           D
That the world, the world comes tumbling down
A
And I wish I could stay
C#min                F#min
But I know it will never be that way
D                                          E
That the world, the world comes tumbling down
                         E
The world comes tumbling down

Verse 2: A C#min F#min D
I can't believe it, You'll never stay
But it's now too long and some got above
But now there's nothing left to say
Who makes the reasons, Who tells us why
But if you would heard about you shout aloud
I wish you leave me here to die

Bridge
Chorus
 
Verse 3:
And my friends, my friends keep telling me
Dry your eyes mate
A                                C#min                F#min
I know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up
D
There's plenty more fish in the sea
Dry your eyes mate
A                                C#min                F#min
I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts
                      D
But you've got to walk away now it's over

Verse 4 (2x):
A
Won't let this world keep tumbling down
C#min
Won't let this world keep tumbling down
F#min
Won't let this world keep tumbling down
D
Oh no no, no no

Chorus
