Intro:  E    A9   E   B7

Verse 1:
E/D#            E/C#         E/B
Today we took a walk up the street
            A
We picked a flower and climbed the hill
          B7
above the lake
E     E/D#      E/C#
Secret thoughts were said aloud
E/B                           A
We watched the faces in the clouds
A                          B7
Until the clouds had blown away
C#m          B7
Were we ever somewhere else?
        A                   B7
You know, it's hard to say

Chorus:
E            A              E
I never saw blue like that before
            B7               E
Across the sky, around the world
                  A                E
You're giving me all you have and more
F#m            F#m/E           B7
No one else has ever shown me how
E                    E/D#         F#
To see the world the way I see it now
A                    B7            E
Oh I... I never saw blue like that...
 B7
before



Verse 2:
E             E/D#       E/C#
I can't believe a month ago
        E/B               A
I was alone, I didn't know you
              A                  B7
I hadn't seen you, or heard your name
          E   E/D#       E/C#
And even now, I'm so amazed
              E/B                  A
It's like a dream, it's like a rainbow
               B7
It's like the rain
C#m                       B7
And some things are the way they are
A                    B7
And words just can't explain

Chorus

Bridge:
       Am         E          A     E
And it feels like now and it feels always
A                        [E   B7]
And it feels like coming home

Chorus

Outro:
   A                 B7            E
Oh I... I never saw blue like that
