Do you have the time to listen to me whine

About nothing and everything all at once

me  down
G           D
I went to a whore
     Em               Bm

And quit my whining cause it's bringing
   D
her  down

C           D                 G
  Sometimes I give myself the creeps
C           D                    G
  Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
    C               D
It all keeps adding up

I think I'm cracking up

Am I just paranoid?
