 a little piece of you is falling away

Tow the line and play their game

Till one day they call your name
You know it's time for the hammer to fall

Verse 3:
For we who grew up tall and proud
In the shadows of the Mushroom Cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
I just wanna scream it louder and louder and louder
 
Chorus 3:
What the hell are we fighting for?
Just surrender and it won't hurt at all
You just got time to say your prayers
While you're waiting for the hammer, the hammer to fall.
