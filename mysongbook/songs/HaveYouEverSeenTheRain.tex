There's a calm before the storm, I know
                   C
It's been coming for some time

C
When it's over, so they say
C                          G
It'll rain a sunny day, I know
                   C
Shining down like water

I wanna know

Coming down on a sunny day

Yesterday and days before
C                                G

Been that way for all my time

C
'Til forever on it goes

And it can't stop, I wonder
