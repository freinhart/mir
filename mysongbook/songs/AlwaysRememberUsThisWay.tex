Verse 1:
             Am                  F
That Arizona sky burning in your eyes
    C                                      G
You look at me and, babe, I wanna catch on fire
                  Am                   F
It's buried in my soul like California gold
    C                                     G
You found the light in me that I couldn't find
 
Chorus 1:
            F
So when I'm all choked up
                     C
and I can't find the words
      Am                            G
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
          F   G    Am
When the sun goes down
        F    G     C
and the band won't play
     F       G               C
I'll always remember us this way
 
Verse 2
              Am                    F
Lovers in the night poets trying to write
    C                                   G
We don't know how to rhyme but damn we try
                 Am                         F
But all I really know you're where I wanna go
    C                                G
The part of me that's you will never die

Chorus 2:
...
     F        G              Bb
I'll always remember us this way, oh, yeah

Bridge:
F
I don't wanna be just a memory, baby, yeah
C
  Hoo-oo-oo, hoo-oo-oo, oo - oo.
Bb
  Hoo-oo-oo, hoo-oo-oo, oo - oo.
F                              G
  Hoo-oo-oo, hoo-oo-oo, oo - oo.
 
Chorus:
            F
So when I'm all choked up
                     C
and I can't find the words
      Am                           G
Every time we say goodbye baby, it hurts
          F   G    Am
When the sun goes down
        F    G     C
and the band won't play
     F       G          Am
I'll always remember us    this way, wo-o-yeah 
 
Outro:
         F    G  Am         F     G     C
When you look at me and the whole world fades
     F       G                     F Bb  F  C
I'll always remember us      this way
