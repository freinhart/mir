Woke up this mornin'
      F         C
Happy as could  be
                 G
I looked out my   window
            C
What did I  see

Coming' up my sidewalk
F                 C
Just as plain as  day
                                        G
Here comes trouble that I never thought I'd  see
              C
When she went away.

C
Hello  trouble
F       C
Come on in
           G
Talk about heartaches
                       C
Where in the world you been

Well, I ain't had the miseries
      F        C
Since you been  gone
            F                  G
Well  hello trouble, trouble,  trouble
        C
Welcome home.

SOLO

C
Well, I'll make a pot of coffee
             F         C
And you  can rest your shoes
                     G
You can tell me them sweet lies
                   C
And I'll listen to you

Well it's just a little part of
            F       C
Part of the life we live
C
But I'd rather have a little bit of trouble
        G                        C
Than to never know the love you give.
