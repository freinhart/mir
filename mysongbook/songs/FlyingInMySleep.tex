Flying in my sleep - Tito and Tarantula (from the 1997 record "Tarantism")


        D                     G                 A
   One night a silver balloon swept me over the sea
   D                                 G               A
   across the Atlantic I found myself headed towards Paris
      D                                        G              A
   I held on to the ropes for dear life it was cold enough to freeze
         D                                        G        A
   the balloon burst and I started to fall then I woke suddenly


Interlude: 2x D, G, A


       D                                 G                 A
   The very next night I saw some whales swim Santa Monica bay
  D                             G           A
   I flew down to greet them I watched them play
          D                                    G             A
   in my nakedness I swam and she spoke in her singing sonic way
          D                                 G             A
   the mother of them all took my hate then send me on my way


   C    G             D
   Flying in my sleep
   C    G             D
   Flying in my sleep

       D                         G                  A
   I visit you almost every night I float over your bed
 D                                       G                      A
   you lay there with open eyes and your husband sleeps in your arms
         D                                       G                     A
   I can see that you`re thinking of me I made a mistake I should have stayed
      D                                G                      A
   I slide between the both of you one kiss and I`ll be on my way

   C   G        D
   Flying in my sleep
        C              G                     D
   they say it`s a gift but it`s a curse for me
   C   G        D
   flying and I see
   C      G             A
   broken dreams and tragedy

Bm                     G
    If I could I would stay with you forever
Bm                          G
    in a dream world that`s complete
Bm                       G
    I`ve got my life and you got yours
A                       D A G A
    but in the night we meet


         D                                  G                  A
    Well I can`t wait till the sun goes down and lay myself to sleep
  D                                   G               A
    I forget about the real life in a dream world incomplete
       D                                        G                   A
    I fall through my mattress up to the clouds high above the earth
          D                                       G             A
    and I find myself looking for you through this wonderful universe

    C   G        D
    Flying in my sleep
         C              G                     D
    they say it`s a gift but it`s a curse for me
    C   G        D
    flying and I see
    C      G            A
    broken dreams and tragedy

           D            G      A
    Oh I`m flying in my sleep
