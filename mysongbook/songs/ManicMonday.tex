D           G              Em          A7          D     G   Em   A7
Six o'clock already I was just in the middle of a dream
        D        G           Em             A7      D        G   Em   A7
I was kissin' Valentino by a crystal blue Italian stream

But I can't be late 'Cause then I guess I just won't get paid
D             G              Em               A7       D        G
These are the days when you wish your bed was already made

Chorus:
                        D        G      A7
It's just another manic Monday
                D        G      A7
I wish it were Sunday
                 D          G      A7
'Cause that's my fun day
                    D        G       A7
My I don't have to run day
                         D
It's just another manic Monday

D                 G           Em          A7      D     G   Em   A7
Have to catch an early train got to be to work by nine
    D           G            Em            A7         D     G   Em   A7
And if I had an aeroplane I still couldn't make it on time
           D           G           Em               A7       D     G   Em  A7
'Cause it takes me so long just to figure out what I'm gonna wear
D                 G           Em       A7       D        G
Blame it on the train but the boss is already there

Bm                                                   E7           (Last night, last night)
All of my nights why did my lover have to pick last night to get down?
   A                                                   D
Doesn't it matter that I have to feed the both of us employment's down
      G                        Em
He tells me in his bedroom voice
           A7*   A7*   A7*        Em
"C'mon honey, let's go make some noise"
   A7
Time it goes so fast   (When you're having fun)
