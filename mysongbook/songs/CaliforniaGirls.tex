Verse 1:
      D                                  C/D
Well, East Coast girls are hip, I really dig those styles they wear
        G
And the Southern girls with the way they talk 
              A
They knock me out when I'm down there
    D                                 C/D
The midwest farmers' daughters really make you feel alright
        G
And the Northern girls with the way they kiss
                A
They keep their boyfriends warm at night

Chorus:
  D                  Em7
I wish they all could be California,
  C                   Dm7
I wish they all could be California,
  A#                   Cm7           D
I wish they all could be California Girls

Verse 2:
    D                                    C/D
The West coast has the sunshine, and the girls all get so tanned
        G
I dig a French bikini on Hawaiian Island dolls
     A
By a palm tree in the sand
  D                                             C/D
I been all around this great big world and I've seen all kinds of girls
      G
But I couldn't wait to get back in the states,
            A
Back to the cutest girls in the world

Chorus
 
Coda:
  D                                  Em7
I wish they all could be California girls
                                           (wish they all could be California)
