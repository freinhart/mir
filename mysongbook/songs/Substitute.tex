[Intro]
| D* D A/D   | G/D D | D* D A/D   | G/D D |
  acoustic guitar (12-string)
| D | % | % | % |
 full band
 
[Verse 1]
D             G                 |  D  |  %  |
 You think we look pretty good together
D             G                 |  D  |  %  |
 You think my shoes are made of leather
 
[Bridge]
         [ Em ]
But I'm a substitute for another guy
 [ Em ]
I look pretty tall but my heels are high
   [ Em ]
The simple things you see are all complicated
 [ Em ]                                      |  A    A6 |  A  |
I look pretty young, but I'm just back-dated, yeah (= LINK)
 
[Chorus]
D* D  A/D         G/D      D
             your lies for fact
(Substitute)
  D*  D     A/D          G/D     D
I see right through your plastic mac
 (Substi-   tute)
  D*   D   A/D           G/D     D
I look all white, but my dad was black
 (Sub- sti-tute)
   D*   D       A/D            G/D        |  D  |  %  |
My fine-looking suit is really made out of sack
  (Sub- sti-    tute)                     [break]
 
[Verse 2]
D                  G               |  D  |  %  |
 I was born with a plastic spoon in my mouth
    D                     G                            |  D  |  %  |
The north side of my town faced east, and the east was facing south
 
[Bridge]
           [ Em ]
And now you dare to look me in the eye
     [ Em ]
Those crocodile tears are what you cry
      [ Em ]
It's a genuine problem, you won't try
  [ Em ]                                         |  A    A6 |  A  |
To work it out at all you just pass it by, pass it by  (= LINK)
 
[Chorus]
 D* D  A/D     G/D    D
               me for him
(Substitute)
D* D  A/D       G/D      D
             my coke for gin
(Substitute)
D* D  A/D       G/D    D
            you for my mum
(Substitute)
   D*    D     A/D   G/D     |  D  |  %  |
At least I'll get my washing done
  (Sub-  st-  itute)         [break)
 
[Solo]
| D | G | D | % |
| D | G | D | % |
