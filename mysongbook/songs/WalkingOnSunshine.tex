I used to think maybe you love me, now baby I'm sure  
and I just cant wait till the day, when you knock on my door  
now every time I go for the mail box, gotta hold myself down  
'cos I just cant wait till you write me, you're coming around  

{Coro:}  
                            D            C

                        D                  C  
I'm walking on sunshine (whoa oh)  
                                G - C - D - C  
And don't it feel good  
                               G - C - D - C  
And don't it feel good  

I used to think maybe you love me, I know that it's true

I don't want you back for the weekend, not back for a day  
baby I just want you back and I want you to stay  

I'm walking on sunshine (whoa oh)  
I'm walking on sunshine (whoa oh)

And don't it feel good  
And don't it feel good  

        G                C              D                     C  
I feel alive, I feel a love, I feel a love that's really real  
I feel alive, I feel a love, I feel a love that's really real
