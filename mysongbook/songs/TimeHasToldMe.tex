Time Has Told Me chords by Nick Drake, 


F        C       F       C

F       C                 F                 C
  Time     has told me        you're a rare, rare find 
C7             F        Dm               G
   A troubled cure         for a troubled mind
F            C              F             C
    And time    has told me     not to ask for more
C7                   F     Dm                    G
   For someday our Ocean        will find its shore

E7                       Eb
   So I'll leave the ways of making me be
Ab6 Ab                       D
        What I really don't want to be
E7                       Eb
  Leave the ways that are making me love
Ab6                       D
     What I really don't want to love

F       C                 F           C
  Time     has told me       you came with the dawn
C7               F           Dm                  G
   A soul with no footprint      a rose with no thorn
F           C               F                C
  Your tears they tell me      there's really no way
C7               F         Dm                      G
  Of ending your troubles     with things you can say
F         C                F              C
  And time will tell you      to stay by my side
C7              F         Dm                 G
   To keep on trying         'til theres no more to hide

E7                        Eb
  So leave the ways that are making you be
Ab6  Ab                        D
        What you really don't want to be
E7                       Eb
  Leave the ways that are making you love
Ab6                        D
    What you really don't want to love

F       C                 F                 C
  Time     has told me        you're a rare, rare find 
C7             F        Dm               G
   A troubled cure         for a troubled mind
F            C              F             C
    And time    has told me     not to ask for more
C7                   F     Dm                    G
   For someday our Ocean        will find its shore

i think it sounds better if you quickly transition from F to Bb to F when you play an F in the 'verses' and similarly from C to F to C when you play the following C. When Nick Drake plays it on Five Leaves Left it sounds like he makes these small transitions among others
