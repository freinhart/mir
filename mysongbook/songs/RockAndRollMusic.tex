E7
Just let me hear some of that

Chorus:
A
Rock and roll music
A
Any old way you choose it
           D           
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
A
Any old time you use it
     E7
It's gotta be rock and roll music
                        A
If you wanna dance with me
E7                      A
If you wanna dance with me

Verse 1:
A                      E
I have no kick against modern jazz
E7                          A
  Unless you try to play it too darn fast
                       D
I lose the beauty of a melody
                            E
Until it sounds just like a symphony
E7
That's why I go for that...

Chorus









Verse 2:
A                       E
I took my love on over 'cross the tracks
E7                        A
So she could hear a man a-wailin' sax
                        D
I must admit they had a rockin' band
                             E
And they were blowin' like a hurrican'
E7
Just let me hear some of that

Chorus

Verse 3:
A                          E
Way down south they gave a jubilee
E7                            A
And Georgia folks, they had a jamboree
                                  D
They're drinkin' home brew from a wooden cup
                      E
The folks dancin' got all shook up
E7
And started playin' that...

Chorus

Verse 4:
A                            E
Don't get to hear 'em play a tango
E7                       A
I'm in no mood to take a mambo
                           D
It's way too early for the congo
                        E
So keep on rockin' that piano
E7
That s why I go for that

Chorus
