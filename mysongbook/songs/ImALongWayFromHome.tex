___________________________
(chorus)
       G   A
I'm a long way from home
G      A
 And so all alone
G                 A                 D
 Homesick, like I never thought I'd be
       G   A
I'm a long way from home
G         A
 And everything is wrong
G               A          D
 Someone please watch over me
___________________________


D       D7                  G
I'm not accustomed to these feelings
A                               D
 The lonliness is burning in my soul
D             D7          G
Sometimes the mind is so misleading
A                                    D
I wish I'd stayed at home like I was told

G         A
 And everything is wrong
G               A          D
 Someone please watch over me

Yeah, this song is from the Walk The Line soundtrack. I hadn't heard it before,
but it's quite cool so I just did the basic chords since nobody else has. There's
some bass runs and alt bass notes here and there, but I'm sure somebody else will
type them up, I'm not bothered to be honest! Good song, enjoy!
