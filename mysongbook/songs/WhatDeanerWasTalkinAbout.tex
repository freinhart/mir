\begin{lstsong}
Verse 1:
            C               G
The wash is out its hanging up
          F               C
And all I have is nothing
           C
Nothing to do nothing to say
        F               C
I think I must be dreaming 

Chorus:
              Am                    C
The sun comes up and I'm all washed out
                 Am                   D
Is this what the Deaner was talking about
        C               G               F         C
I don't think I'll ever return again my friend

Verse 2:
         C               G
If I was king I'd wear a ring
          F             C
And never hurt my people
         C                      G
I'd stay alert and dress to kill
             F                 C
I might even slip you something

Chorus

Solo: C G F C F C Am C Am D C F G F C

Chorus:
              Am                    C
The sun comes up and I'm all washed out
                Am                   D
Is this what the Deaner was talking about
        C               G               F         C (3x)
I don't think I'll ever return again my friend
