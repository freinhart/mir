Intro: | C G | Am Fmaj7 F6 | C G | F C | (2x)

Verse 1:
       C              G
When I find myself in times of trouble,
Am            Fmaj7       F6
Mother Mary comes to me
C                 G              F C (Dm7 C)
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
    C             G
And in my hour of darkness,
       Am                Fmaj7      F6
she is standing right in front of me
C                 G              F C (Dm7 C)
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be

Chorus 1:
       Am         C/G        F          C
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
C                G              F C (Dm7 C)
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

Verse 2:
    C               G
And when the broken hearted people
Am            Fmaj7      F6
living in the world agree
C                G              F C Dm7 C
There will be an answer, let it be
    C                  G
But though they may be parted, there is
Am                  Fmaj7       F6
still a chance that they may see
C                G              F C Dm7 C
There will be an answer, let it be

Chorus 2:
C      Am         C/G        F          C
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
C                G              F C Dm7 C
There will be an answer, let it be
C      Am         C/G        F          C
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
C                G              F C Dm7 C
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And when the night is cloudy,

there is still a light that shines on me
C                 G            F C Dm7 C
Shine on till tomorrow, let it be
  C              G
I wake up to the sound of music,
Am          Fmaj7      F6
Mother Mary comes to me
