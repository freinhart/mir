Intro:
B D#m A C#m G  Bm E

Verse 1:
        B            D#m
I feel sorrow for the fear
      A              C#m 
And everything it brings
   G         Bm          E     A (002220)
Wonder if it will ever sleep
   B           D#m
I know you understand
             A           C#m
Because you briefly look away
G            Bm
Focusing on nothing 
   E                  A
So now everything is clear


A                       D
Cause there's no one to blame
                     A                    
You got no place to hide
                   D
It's only in your mind
           A       C#m
And I saw you - in amazement
Bm                     E
Stumbling through the day
             A            C#m
You told me time - never waits
          Bm              E
What is that supposed to mean?








Chorus:
        D
All of life
           C#m
Is in one drop of the ocean
              Bm
Waiting to go home
                    A
Just waiting to go home
           D
And if the moon
              C#m
Can turn the tides it can pull the tears
                        Bm
and take them from our eyes
                     A
And make them into monsoons                
And turn them into mon -
D                                    C#m
Sooner or later they'll weave their way back to the sea
                   Bm
Gonna finally be free
                   A
Yeah, free for a while
            D
Until they break
               C#m
Like waves of sorrow
                    Bm
Always do, all in due time
                     A
Because time never waits
