D                                A
Take me to heart and I'll always love you
      G                          D   
And nobody else could make me do wrong    
                                     A
Take me for granted and I'll tag  along
                 G                   D
Makes will power weak and temptation strong 
E                                        E7

A woman's only human this you must understand 
A

She's not just a play thing she expects love just like a man

So if you wanna do right all day woman   
               A7                  D       A   D
You gotta be a do right all night man 

D               A                                  D

They say that's it's a man's world 
F#m
But you can't prove that by me
Bm                                                                
So as long as we're together baby 
           A    Asus             A7
You better show some respect  for me
                G  D     Dsus    Em
So if you wanna do right all day woman   
               A7                 D     
You gotta be a do right all night man 
               A7                 D
You gotta be a do right all night man 
               A7                 D
You gotta be a do right all night man 
               A7                 G      D
You gotta be a do right all night man
