Intro: D  Dsus4  D  Dsus4  D

Verse 1:
D                        Am
 She ebbs and flows like water
        G    C          G
And she feels just like wine
    D                  Am
She loves the things I bought her
       G   C          G       Dsus4  D
When I did not have a dime

Verse 2:
D                                Am
    There were times I felt like hidin'
          G  C            G
She could al-most read my mind
D                          Am
 In her yard the trees are dyin'
                G      C               G
Mmm and there's nothing growing on the vine

Chorus:
Bm                      F#7
    I'll be here if you need me
        Bm               A  Asus2 A Asus2 A
I'll be here even if you don't
D            Bm    D7 G                 D
 Show me the door, or show me something more
        D      A               D
Take me in, or shove me out to sea

Instrumental: D  Am  G  C G (2x) D

Verse 3:
D                    Am
 She lift me up like powder
        G         C       G
And she scattered me like dust
D                           Am
 A broken bell in a crooked tower
        G    C             G
Born to fall, and built to rust
 
Bridge: 
C# D D# E
        Couldnt see much deeper than a penny onthe ground
A                          E
Looked as far as flesh and bone
Esus2   N.C.                  Esus2
     So that was all we found

Verse 5:
D                              Am
 She told me there's no way of knowing
         G   C                  G
When the last time had come and gone
D                           Am
 We can't reap what we been sowing
            G        C        G
Waiting for answers, farther along

Chorus

Outro: D  D9  G  D  A G  D
