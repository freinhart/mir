Verse:
D      G         F     Em        D           
I'll start this off without any words
  G       F      Em                D
I Got so high I scratched till it bled
C    Bm       A          D         G      F        Em             D
Love myself, Better than you, I know it's wrong so what should I do?
    G       F       Em       D
The finest day that I ever had
      G      F        Em      D
Was when I learned to cry on command
C    Bm       A          D         G      F        Em             D    
Love myself, Better than you, I know it's wrong so what should I do?
Chorus:
D   G   F  
          I'm on a plain 
D   G   F 
          I can't complain 
D   G   F 
          I'm on a Plain 
Verse:
My brother died every night
It's safe to say don't quote me on that
Love myself, Better than you, I know it's wrong so what should I do?
The black sheep got black mailed again
Forgot to put on the zip code
Love myself, Better than you, I know it's wrong so what should I do?
Chorus
Bridge:
F         E                  A        G
Some where I have heard this before
F      E                  A        G
In a dream my memory has stored
F      E                    A        G
In defense I'm neutered and spayed
F         E                  A        G
What the hell am I trying to say?
Verse:  
It is now time to make it unclear
To write off lines that don't make sense
Love myself, Better than you, I know it's wrong so what should I do?
One more special message to go
Then I'm done and I can go home
Love myself, Better than you, I know it's wrong so what should I do?
Chorus: (repeat)
D   G   F  
          I'm on a Plain 
          I can't complain
