Verse:
D      G         F     Em        D           
I'll start this off without any words
  G       F      Em                D
I Got so high I scratched till it bled
C    Bm       A          D         G      F        Em             D
Love myself, Better than you, I know it's wrong so what should I do?
    G       F       Em       D
The finest day that I ever had
      G      F        Em      D
Was when I learned to cry on command
C    Bm       A          D         G      F        Em             D    
Love myself, Better than you, I know it's wrong so what should I do?

Chorus:
D   G   F  
          I'm on a plain 
D   G   F 
          I can't complain 
D   G   F 
          I'm on a Plain 

Verse:
D   G       F    Em    D
My brother died every night
       G      F        Em          D
It's safe to say don't quote me on that
C    Bm       A          D         G      F        Em             D
Love myself, Better than you, I know it's wrong so what should I do?
    G           F   Em            D
The black sheep got black mailed again
G       F     Em         D
Forgot to put on the zip code
C    Bm       A          D         G      F        Em             D    
Love myself, Better than you, I know it's wrong so what should I do?

Chorus

Bridge:
F         E                  A        G
Some where I have heard this before
F      E                  A        G
In a dream my memory has stored
F      E                    A        G
In defense I'm neutered and spayed
F         E                  A        G
What the hell am I trying to say?

Verse:
D  G      F       Em          D    
It is now time to make it unclear
   G        F           Em          D
To write off lines that don't make sense
C    Bm       A          D         G      F        Em             D
Love myself, Better than you, I know it's wrong so what should I do?
G          F       Em       D
One more special message to go
G         F       Em         D
Then I'm done and I can go home
C    Bm       A          D         G      F        Em             D   
Love myself, Better than you, I know it's wrong so what should I do?

Chorus:
D   G   F  
          I'm on a Plain 
D   G   F 
          I can't complain 
D   G   F 
          I'm on a Plain 
D   G   F 
          I can't complain
D   G   F 
          I'm on a Plain
