I'd do it all better if I could do it again

Verse 3:
                                    F            C
Then an old lady asked me bout this new daylight time
                                            G
I said it don't matter and she said I don't mind
         C                         F        C
Then the bus driver said you still owe me a dime
            G          C
Ain't it a cold, cold world

Verse 5:
                               F          C
I might have to leave you, I think's what she said
                                        G
Wish I could sleep 'stead of tossing in bed
      C                           F          C
And I find myself thinking I'd be better off dead
            G          C
Ain't it a cold, cold world
            G          C
Ain't it a cold, cold world
