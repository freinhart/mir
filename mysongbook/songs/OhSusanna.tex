Verse 1:
     C                                    G
Oh I came from Alabama with a banjo on my knee,
    C                                G7     C   C7
I'm going to Louisiana, my true love for to see.
   C                                                   G
It rained all night the day I left, the weather it was dry
    C                                     G7        C    C7
The sun so hot I froze to death; Susanna, don't you cry.

Chorus:
F            C                 G
Oh, Susanna, don't you cry for me
      C                                G7    C
For I came from Alabama, with my banjo on my knee.

Verse 2:
  C                                               G
I had a dream the other night when everything was still,
  C                            G7          C     C7
I thought I saw Susanna coming up/down the hill,
    C                                                    G
The buckwheat cake was in her mouth, the tear was in her eye,
  C                                       G7        C    C7
I said I'm coming from Dixieland, Susanna don't you cry.
 

Chorus:
F            C                 G
Oh, Susanna, don't you cry for me
      C                                  G7    C
For I'm going to Louisiana with my banjo on my knee.

Verse 3:
  C                                                G
I soon will be in New Orleans, and then I'll look around
    C                                      G7      C     C7
And when I find my gal Susanne, I'll fall upon the ground.
    C                                           G
But if I do not find her, this darkey'll surely die,
    C                                 G7        C    C7
and when I'm dead and buried, Susanna don't you cry.

Chorus
