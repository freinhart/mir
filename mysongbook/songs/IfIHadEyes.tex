Intro (barre chords): C G2 F Dm7 (x2)
Verse:
C                    G2
If I had eyes in the back of my head
        F                                  Dm7
I would tell you that you looked good as I walked away
C                                  G2
If you could've tried to trust the hand that fed
             F                         Dm7               C   F  Dm7
You would've never been hungry but you never really be
    C                               G2
The more of this or less of this or is there any difference
F                       Dm7                          G
or we just holding onto things that we don't have anymore

Chorus:
          C            Dm7  F         C
Sometimes time doesn't heal no not at all
   C           Dm7   F        C
It just stands still while we fall
C     Dm7         F       C
In or out of love again I doubt
          C       Dm7               F         C
I'm gonna win you back when you got eyes like that
                  G
They won't let me in
               C  G2  F  Dm7
Always looking out

Verse:
C                           G2
A lot of people spend their time just floating
F               Dm7
We were victims together but lonely
C                        G2
You got hungry eyes that just can't look forward
      F                       Dm7
Can't give them enough but we just can't start over
C                              G2
Building with bent nails we're falling but holding
F                     Dm7             G
I don't wanna take up anymore of your time
G
Time time time

Chorus

Outro:         C     G2  F  Dm7
Always looking out...oooooooooh
