Intro:
A   E   D   Bm   (x2)
Verse 1:
A                    E                             D
If I had eyes in the back of my head, I would have told you that
                     Bm               A      E     D     Bm
You looked good As I walked away
A                    E
And if you could've tried to trust the hand that fed
             D             Bm                           A    E    D    Bm
You would've never been hungry But you never really be
       A                            E
The more of this or less of this or is there any difference
   D                            Bm                        A
or are we just holding onto the things we don't have anymore

Chorus:
          A            Bm   D         A
Sometimes time doesn't heal No not at all
A          Bm    D            A
Just stand still While we fall
A     Bm          D     A                 A       Bm
In or out of love again I doubt I'm gonna win you back
D            A
When you got eyes like that
                   E Em hammer-ons
It won't let me in
               A   E   D   Bm
Always looking out

Verse 2:
A                         E
Lot of people spend their time just floating
D                   Bm
We were victims together but lonely
A                        E
You got hungry eyes that just can't look forward
D                             Bm
Can't give them enough but we just can't start over
A
Building with bent nails we're
E                     D                     Bm
falling but holding, I don't wanna take up anymore of your time
Time time time
Chorus
Outro:
It won't let me in
                A   E   D   Bm  (x4)
Always lookin out
