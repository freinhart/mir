Intro: D F#m G A

Verse 1:
D         F#m      G               A
Cross the border, into the big bad world
D                                        F#m
Where it takes you about an hour just to cross the road,
        G                      A                       D                       F#m
Just to stumble across another poor old sole, From the dreary old lanes to the High Street madness,
  G                        A                       D                         F#m
I fight with my brain to believe my eyes. And it's harder than you think to believe this sadness,
   G                                A
It creeps up my spine and haunts me through the night

Chorus:
Bm7                                       G
Life is good, and the girls are gorgeous, Suddenly the air smells much greener now
    Bm7                                                A
And I'm walking around with a half pack of cigarettes, Searching for the change I've lost somehow

Verse 2:
D            F#m         G               A
Where'd the days go? When all we did was play
    D                             F#m
And the stress that we were under wasn't stress at all
       G                     A                  D                           F#m
Just a run and a jump into a harmless fall from walking by a high-rise to a landmark square
    G                           A                        D                        F#m
You see millions of people with millions of cares. And I struggle to the train to make my way home
  G                          A
I look at the people as they sit there alone

Chorus

Bridge:
      D                     F#m
These streets have too many names for me
    G                                   A
I'm used to Glenfield road and spending my time down in Orchy
D                     F#m           G       A
I'll get used to this eventually, I know, I know

Outro:
