Intro: B  E C#m F# (2x)

Verse 1:
B        E             C#m
  You win it's your show now, 
   F#
So what's it going to be? 
B             E            
  cause people will tune in,
C#m                     F#
  How many train wrecks do we need to see? 
B       E          C#m
  Before we lose touch, 
    F#
And we thought this was low 
B           E              C#m  
  Well it's bad, getting worse...

Chorus:
F#                B       E    C#m
Where'd all the good people go?
            F#              B
I've been changing channels and
             E          C#m
I don't see them on the TV shows 
F#               B       E     C#m
Where'd all the good people go?
            F#                B   E C#m F# 
We've got heaps and heaps of what we sow 

Verse 2:
         B			E
They got this and that with a rattle a tat 
    C#m               F#
Testing, one, two, man whatcha gonna do 
    B		      E
Bad news misused, got too much to lose 
C#m			      F#
Give me some truth now, who's side are we on 
    B           E        C#m
Whatever you say, Turn on the boob tube,
F#
I'm in the mood to obey
    B           E            C#m
So lead me astray, And by the way now... 

Chorus

Bridge Solo

Bridge:
E                             B    C  C#
  Sitting around feeling far away,
        F#                          F   
So far away but I can feel the debris, can you feel it?
E                     B           C C#
 You interrupt me from a friendly conversation
           F#                             F
To tell me how great it's all going to be
E                   B         C C#
  You might notice some hesitation
                            F#            F E
It's important to you, it's not important to me
             B                          C C#
But way down by the edge of yo-ur reason
                          E
It's beginning to show, & all I really wanna know is

Chorus  (Where'd all the good people go?)


Verse 5:
         B			E
They got this and that with a rattle a tat 
    C#m               F#
Testing, one, two, man whatcha gonna do 
    B		   E
Bad news misused, give me some truth
        C#m			   F#                    
You got too much to lose,  Whose side are we on
                          (Where'd all the ...?)
   B                   E
today anyway, Okay whatever you say
C#m			       F#   
Wrong and resolute but in the mood to obey
  B           E            C#m          F#
Station to station, desensitizing the nation
                          (Where'd all the ...?)       
B
Going, going, gone
