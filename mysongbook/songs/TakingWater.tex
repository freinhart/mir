Intro: D   Am   Em   D (2x)

Verse 1:
 D                       Am
Cold cold ashes on the ground
Em                          D
 Nothing lost and nothing found
   D                            Am
Friends and loved ones falling down
Em                              D
 Can't you hear that mournful sound?

D                     Am
Nothing left but memories
Em                              D
 Things I still can't stand to see
D                        Am
There's an empty spot in me
Em                         D
 Where my hometown used to be

Chorus:
 D        Am             G
This old boat is taking water
             G                 D
It won't be long 'til it goes down
       Am             C
Had enough to push us over
G                         Am
 Time to turn the wheel around

Bridge: D   Am   Em   D (2x)

Verse 2:
D                       Am
Neighborhoods left to decay
Em                       D
 People died or walked away
D                                 Am
There's nowhere left for them to stay
Em                           D
 And we just look the other way

Am  C  G  Am

Verse 3:
D                                Am
Waves keep pounding through the night
Em                       D
 Lost without a ray of light
D                     Am
Going down without a fight
Em                               D
Is there still time to make it right?

Chorus

Outro:
          Am             G
This old boat is taking water
          G                 D
Won't be long 'til it goes down
       Am             C
Had enough to push us over
G                         Am   Am  Am  Am
 Time to turn the wheel around
