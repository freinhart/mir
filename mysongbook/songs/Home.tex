Intro: D Em G
Strophe 1:
D
I gotta get home, there's a garden to tend
All the fruit's on the ground
                                  Em
And the birds have all moved back into my attic whistling static
                                                          D
When the young learn to fly I will patch all the holes up again
D
Well, I can't believe that my lime tree is dead
                                                      Em
I thought it was sleeping, I guess it got fed up with not being fed
And I would be too I need food in my belly
                            D
And hope that my time isn't soon.

Chorus 1:
D                             Em
So I try to understand what I can't hold in my hand
    G                A                        D
And whatever I find, I'll find my way back to you
D
And if you could try to find it too
            Em
'Cause this place has overgrown into waxing mood
G                                  A          D
Home is wherever we are if there's love there too

Strophe 2:
D
In the back of our house there's a trail that won't end
We were walking so far that it grew back in
            Em
Now there's no trail at all, only grass growing tall
                                              D
Get out my machete and battle with time once again
Em                                                        D
But I'm 'bout to lose 'cause I'll be damned if time don't win
D
I gotta get home there's a garden to tend
All the seeds from the fruit buried and began
      Em
Their own family trees, teach them thank you and please
                                                                D
As they spread their own roots then watch the young fruit grow again
Em                                                   D
This old trail will lead me right back to where it begins
