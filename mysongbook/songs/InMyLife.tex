Verse 1:
          A      E   F#m   A7/G    
There are places I remember
       D   Dm           A
All my life___, though some have changed,
        A    E       F#m     A7/G 
Some forever not for better,
           D   Dm        A
Some have gone___ and some remain.

Bridge 1:
          F#m               D
All these places have their moments,
     G                    A
With lovers and friends I still can recall.
         F#m               B
Some are dead and some are living,
   Dm7           A
In my life I've loved them all

Intro

Verse 2:
       A         E           F#m   A7/G
But of all these friends and lovers,
         D  Dm      A
There is no-one compares with you,
           A        E          F#m   A7/G
And these memories lose their meaning
        D       Dm      A
When I think of love as something new.
