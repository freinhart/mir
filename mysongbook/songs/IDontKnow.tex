Intro: Gadd5 (8x)

Verse 1:
C/D/Gadd5
I don't know, baby, where we stand
C/D/Gadd5
Where's the future that we planned
         G/A/D
So long ago
        C/D/Gadd5
I don't know

Verse 2:
C/D/Gadd5
I don't know if you're my friend
C/D/Gadd5
Or a long lost lover coming back again
              G/A/D
Where did you go
             C/D/Gadd5
Baby I don't know

Bridge 1:
      F/G/Cadd9
You'd think by now that I would know better
C/D/Gadd5
But I ain't got a lot to show
F/G/C
I could write a song I could write a letter
G/A/D
I could write a book about I don't know





Verse 3:
C/D/Gadd5
Watch my life fall through the cracks
C/D/Gadd5
Like a long gone train that ain't coming back
             G/A/D
Where did it go
        C/D/Gadd5      
I don't know

Bridge 2:
   C/D/Gadd5
My past is pretty rocky, my future ain't long
C/D/Gadd5
Why do I think we got a chance at all
               G/A/D
Where does the wind blow
             C/D/Gadd5
Baby I don't know
               G/A/D
Where does the wind blow
             C/D/Gadd5
Baby I don't know
