Chorus:
         A    D        A 
I don't know where I'm bound
            A    D        A 
I don't know where I'm bound
          D           A 
Whistles calling me away
        D                A 
leaving at the break of day and
          A   D        A 
I don't know where I'm bound
        A    E         A 
I don't know where I'm bound


Verse 1:
           A      D       A
Can't stand locks, bars or doors
          D            A
mean cops insanity and wars
      D               A
Gotta find a place of peace
     D                    A
Till then much travellin' on seas
            A
but I don't know where I'm bound
        A
I don't know where I'm bound


Verse 2:
         A         D         A
There's gotta be a place for me
                 D       A
under some green growing tree
           D             A
clear cool water running by
           D           A
unfettered view of the sky
      A
but I don't know where I'm bound
         A
I don't know where I'm bound

Verse 3:
       A         D    A
When I die don't bury me
             D       A
cause then I must be free
   D            A
cremate my body with a grin
         D            A
throw my ashes to the wind
              A
cause I don't know where I'm bound
        A
I don't know where I'm bound


Verse 4:
   A        D      A
Got myself a little gall
               D          A
she has been a damn right pall
         D                 A
that ol' highway's calling me
    D            A
and free I gotta be but
         A
I don't know where I'm bound
        A
I don't know where I'm bound
