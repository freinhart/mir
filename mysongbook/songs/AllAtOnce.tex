Intro: Am C F Dm C

       Am                      C
All at once, the world can overwhelm me.
                 C                      F
There's (almost) nothing that you could tell me
           Dm      C
That could ease my mind
                   Am
Which way will you run?
                       C
When it's always all around you
                         F
And the feeling lost and found you again
                  Dm      C
A feeling that we have no control
           Am
Around the sun, some say
                      C
It's gone be the new hell, some say
                         F
It's still too early to tell, some say
                              Dm       C
Some say it (really) ain't no myth at all

Dm                  G
  We keep asking ourselves
              C      F
Are we really strong enough?
Dm                 G
  There're so many things
            C            F
That we got    too proud of
          Dm            G
Too proud of, too proud of

          C
I want to take the preconceived
           G
Out from underneath your feet
         F
We could shake it off
              C
Instead we'll plant some seeds
      C
We'll watch them as they grow
          G
And with each new beat
            F
From your heart the roots grow deeper
    C                             F
The branches, well they reach for what?
              C
Nobody really knows
F
    But underneath it all
                       C
There's this heart all alone
F                              Fm
    (But) What about when it's gone?
C                     E
It really won't be so long
             F
Sometimes it feels like a heart
      G                           C
Is no place to be singing from at all

          C
There's a world we've never seen
               G
There's still hope between the dreams
      F                          C
The weight of it all could blow away with a breeze
              C
But if you're waiting on the wind
G
Don't forget to breathe
               F
Because as the darkness gets deeper
      C                       F
We're sinking so we reach for love

                          C
At least something we can hold
F
    But I'll reach to you
                           C
From where time just can't go
F                        Fm
    What about when it's gone?
C                     E
It really won't be so long
             F
Sometimes it feels like a heart
      G                           C
Is no place to be singing from at all.
