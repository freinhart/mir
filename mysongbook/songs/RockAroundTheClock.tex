Put your glad rags on and join me, hon,
                             A7
we'll have some fun when the clock strikes one
            D7
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight,
                  A
we're gonna rock, rock, rock, 'til broad daylight.
            E7                 D7                A
We're gonna rock, gonna rock, around the clock tonight.

         A
When the clock strikes two, three and four,
                             A7
if the band slows down we'll yell for more
            D7
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight,
                  A
we're gonna rock, rock, rock, 'til broad daylight.
            E7                 D7                A
We're gonna rock, gonna rock, around the clock tonight.
Solo
When the chimes ring five, six and seven,
we'll be right in seventh heaven.
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight,
we're gonna rock, rock, rock, 'til broad daylight.
We're gonna rock, gonna rock, around the clock tonight.

When it's eight, nine, ten, eleven too,
I'll be goin' strong and so will you.
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight,
we're gonna rock, rock, rock, 'til broad daylight.
We're gonna rock, gonna rock, around the clock tonight.
Solo
When the clock strikes twelve, we'll cool off then,
start a rockin' round the clock again.
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight,
we're gonna rock, rock, rock, 'til broad daylight.
We're gonna rock, gonna rock, around the clock tonight.
