Intro: | G    | G   Gsus2 |

Verse 1:
G
 I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
                        Am             Em
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
                          C       G
So I sit quietly, agree politely
 
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
                   Am                     Em
I let you push me past the breaking point
                                   C
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything
 
Pre-Chorus:
    G
You held me down, but I got up
                 Am
Already brushing off the dust
    Em
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
                    C
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
    G
You held me down, but I got up
                     Am
Get ready cause I've had enough
  Em
I see it all, I see it now
 
Chorus:
          C           G
I got the eye of the tiger, the fighter,
                     Am
Dancing through the fire
      Em                                C       G
Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
                       Am
Louder, louder than a lion
      Em                                C       G
Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
                    Am   Em
Oh oh oh..., Oh oh oh..., Oh oh oh...
              C       G   Gsus2
You're gonna hear me roar
 
Verse 2:
G
 Now I'm floatin' like a butterfly
                      Am               Em
Stingin' like a bee I earned my stripes
                             C
I went from zero, to my own hero
 
Pre-Chorus
 
 
Chorus:
...
                          Am                    Em
Oh oh oh..., (Hey) Oh oh oh..., (You'll hear me roar) Oh oh oh...
              C       G      Am  Em    D
You're gonna hear me roar
 
Interlude: soft/muted slowly building
    D              D D D D
Roar, roar, roar, roar
