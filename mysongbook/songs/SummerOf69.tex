    Standin' on your mama's porch
D                          G
    You told me that you'd wait forever
Bm                   A
    Oh, and when you held my hand
D                      G
    I knew that it was now or never

Bridge:
F               Bb
   Man, we were killin' time
        C
We were young and restless
   Bb
We needed to unwind
F          Bb                  C
   I guess nothin' can last forever, forever no

Instrumental: D    A  (x2)

Verse 4:
D
   And now the times are changin'
A
   Look at everything that's come and gone

   Sometimes when I play that old six-string
A
   I think about you, wonder what went wrong

Chorus 2

Outro: D  A  (repeat)
