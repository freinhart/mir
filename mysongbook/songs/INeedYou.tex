Great tab, but not quite correct in the bridge, I think. Here's what I hear:

Bridge
A    Aaug    D           
Oh yes you told me 
    E                       A   
You don't want my lovin' anymore.   
     Aaug      D           E           
That's when it hurt me and feeling like this 
  B             Bm    E(7)
I just can't go on anymore.
