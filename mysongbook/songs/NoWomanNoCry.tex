Verse 1:
C        G/B      Am                  F
  Said I remember when we used to sit
C              G/B           Am          F
  In the government yard in Trenchtown.

  So dry your  tears I     say                            And

Chorus

Verse 2:
Said I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown.
And then Georgie would make a fire light
As it was log wood burnin' through the night.
Then we  would cook corn meal porridge
of which I'll share with you.
My feet is my only carriage,
So, I've got to push on through, but while I'm gone

Bridge:
C                     G/B          Am                  F    G
  Ev'ry thing's gonna be alright.  Ev'ry thing's gonna be alright.
C                     G/B          Am                  F    G
  Ev'ry thing's gonna be alright.  Ev'ry thing's gonna be alright.

Chorus
