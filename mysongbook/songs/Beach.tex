Intro

Strophe 1:
This morning, I woke up
went to the kitchen, grabbed a coffee mug
I lit up a cigarette
looked out the window: see and sand

Bridge 1:
Vacations, here I come
Summer time, having fun

Strophe 2:
I measure 12 Beaufort
gusts are stronger, I want more
I rig up board and sail
and scream "(Comon) let's play!"

Bridge 2:
I'm surfin'/riding, I'm surfin'/riding along the beach

Strophe 2:
I walk along the beach
sun is shining, (I got) sand on my feet
There she appeared suddenly
Bikini (on) top and hot pants on
I asked her: "Is it OK?"
to love her right on the beach / to dig a hole in her head

Bridge 2:
I'm diggin, I'm digging on the beach

Chorus:
I gonna give my loving to you, and
You gonna give your lovin' to me
We gonna make love, we gonna make love
on the beach

Strophe 3:
I want you on the sand
come on baby, take my hand
I love you and 
you love me

Bridge 2:
I'm running, I'm running along the beach

Chorus
