Intro

Strophe 1:
This morning, I woke up
went to the kitchen, grabbed a coffee mug
I lit up a cigarette
looked out the window: see and sand

Bridge 1:
Vacations, vacations, here I come
Summer time, having fun

Bridge (Guitar)

Strophe 2:
I measure 12 Beaufort
gusts are stronger, I want more
I rig up board and sail
and scream "(Comon) let's play!"

Bridge 2:
I'm surfin', I'm surfin' along the beach
I'm riding, I'm riding along the beach

Chorus 1:
We are on the beach tonight
We gonna be alright
We gonna have fun
We gonna have fun

Bridge (Guitar)

Strophe 2:
I walk along the beach
sun is shining, (I got) sand on my feet
There she appeared suddenly
Bikini (on) top and hot pants on

Bridge 2:
I want her, She wants me
I want her, on the beach
(I want her to want me,
She wants me to love her)

Chorus 2:
I gonna give my loving to you, and
You gonna give your lovin' to me
We gonna make love, we gonna make love
on the beach

Bridge (Guitar)

Strophe 3:
I want you on the sand
come on baby, take my hand
I love you and 
you love me

Bridge 3:
I have her, She has me
I have her, on the beach

Chorus
