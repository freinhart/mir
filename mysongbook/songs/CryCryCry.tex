E
Everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down
                                   F#7      B7
I think you only live to see the lights up town

I wasted my time when I would try try try
     A                                        B7      E
cos when the lights have lost their glow you cry cry cry

Soon your sugar daddies will all be gone
                                 F#7           B7
you'll wake up some cold day and find you're alone

you'll call for me but I'm gonna tell you bye bye bye
        A                                B7      E
when I turn around and walk away you'll cry cry cry

E
You're gonna cry cry cry, and you'll cry alone
      A                               E
when everyone's forgotten an' you're left on your own

I lie awake at night an' wait till you come in,
                                        F#7    B7
you stay a little while and then you're gone again
         E
every question that I ask I get a lie lie lie
      A                             B7      E
for every lie you tell you're gonna cry cry cry

When your fickle love gets old no one will care for you
                                          F#7         B7
Then you'll come back to me for a little love that's true
      E
I'll tell you no an' then you'll ask me why why why

             B7      E
you're gonna cry cry cry

You're gonna cry cry cry and you'll want me then
         A                          E
it will hurt when you think of the fool you've been

you're gonna cry cry cry
