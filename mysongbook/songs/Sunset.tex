Intro: C G F Am Dm F C G

Strophe 1:
The sun sets on the mountains
soon fades away
left me in the valley
down in my grave

it hurts, it hurts, it hurts
with you I got the faith

Chorus:
To hold on, hold on, to hold on, to hold on, until the
2x Sun has gone from me
from me, old me, the sun has gone from me and my soul

Strophe 2:
But when the sun has set
the moon, the moon,
The moon is the only 
light on my way
You, you are loyal
with you I've got the faith

Chorus
To hold on, hold on, to hold on, to hold on, until the
2x My breath has gone from me
from me, old me, my breath has gone from me and 

my soul, my soul,
my breath has gone from my soul
from me, old me, my breath has gone from me and my soul
