Intro: A
Verse 1:
A               E          F#m          Dm
First thing I remember was asking papa, why,
    A               F               A
For there were many things I didn't know.
                 E          F#m            D
And daddy always smiled and took me by the hand,
        A       E           A
Saying, someday you'll understand.

Chorus:
          E                              A
Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son,
         E                         A
That you better learn it fast, you better learn it young,
       Bm    D       A
'Cause someday never comes.

Verse 2:
      A              E            F#m         Dm
Well, time and tears went by, and I collected dust.
    A               F               A
For there were many things I didn't know.
                 E             F#m         D
When daddy went away, he said, try to be a man,
    A       E           A
And someday you'll understand.

Chorus

Verse 3:
And then one day in April, I wasn't even there,
For there were many things I didn't know.
A son was born to me. Mama held his hand,
Sayin' someday you'll understand.

Chorus
      Bm      D     A
Oooh, someday never comes.

Verse 4:
Bb              F           Gm           Ebm
Think it was September, the year I went away,
    Bb              Gb              Bb
For there were many things I didn't know.
                    F        Gm             Eb
And I still see him standing tryin' to be a man,
        Bb      F           Bb
I said, someday you'll understand.

Chorus
          F                              Bb
Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son,
         F                         Bb
That you better learn it fast, you better learn it young,
       Cm      Eb*   Bb
'Cause someday never comes.
      Cm      Eb*   Bb
Oooh, someday never comes.

Outro: Cm  Eb Bb (6x)
