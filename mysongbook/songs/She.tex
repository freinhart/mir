Intro: G

Verse 1:
G                   D                 C                            G    C G
She, she screams in silence, a sullen riot penetrating through her mind
G                D                  C                             G    C G
Wai-ting  for  a sign to smash the silence with a brick of self control

Chorus:
D                                   C               G
Are you locked up in a world that's planned out for you?
D                             C              G
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use?
C         G         C       G          C      G             D
Scream at me, until my ears bleed, I'm taking heed just for you.

She, she has figured out that all her doubts were someone elses point of view
G               D                  C                              G     C G
