Em7           C                   G
Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry

You don't know how lovely you are
Em7            C                    G
   I had to find you, tell you I need you
            D6
Tell you I set you apart
Em7             C                        G
  Tell me your secrets, and ask me your questions
              D6
Oh let's go back to the start
Em7           C                  G
  Running in circles, coming up tails

Heads on a science apart

 Nobody said it was easy

 Nobody said it was easy

Em7           C                      G
I was just guessing at numbers and figures
            D6
Pulling the puzzles apart
Em7            C                   G
 Questions of science, science and progress
                D6
Don't speak as loud as my heart
Em7           C                   G
Tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
          D6
Oh and I rush to the start
Em7           C                   G
Running in circles, chasing our tails
         D6
Coming back as we are

  Nobody said it was easy

I'm going back to the start
