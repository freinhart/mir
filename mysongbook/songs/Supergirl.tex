\begin{lstsong}
                    Em                           Bm
You can tell by the way, she walks that she's my girl
                    Am                           C
You can tell by the way, she talks she rules the world
                   Em                      Bm
You can see in her eyes that no one is her chief
         Am            C
She's my girl, my supergirl

Chorus:
               G                    D
And then she'd say it's okay, I got lost on the way
               Em                         C
But I'm a supergirl, and supergirls don't cry
               G                       D
And then she'd say it's alright, I got home late last night
               Em                        C
But I'm a supergirl, and supergirls just fly

Verse 2:
                    Em              Bm
And then she'd say that nothing can go wrong
                    Am             C
When you're in love, what can go wrong
                    Em                  Bm
And then she'd laugh the night time into day
         Am             C
Pushing her fear farther along

Chorus
               G
And then she'd shout down the line
                D
Tell me she's got no more time
               Em                           C
Cause she's a supergirl and supergirls don't cry
                G
And then she'd scream in my face
           D
Tell me to leave, leave this place,
                   Em                       C
cause she's a supergirl and supergirls just fly

             G            D                   Em
She's a Supergirl, a Supergirl. She's sowing seeds, she's burning trees
              C                   Em                  G            D
She's sowing seeds, she's burning trees. She's a Supergirl, a Supergirl
     Em           C
A Supergirl, my Supergirl
