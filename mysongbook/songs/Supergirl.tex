\beginverse\memorize
You can tell by the \[Em]way, she walks that she's my \[Bm]girl
You can tell by the \[Am]way, she talks she rules the \[C]world
You can see in her \[Em]eyes that noone is her \[Bm]chief
She's my \[Am]girl, my super\[C]girl
\endverse

\beginchorus    
And then she'd \[G]say it's okay
I got \[D]lost on the way
But I'm a super\[Em]girl, and supergirls don't \[C]cry
And then she'd \[G]say its allright
I got \[D]home late last night
But I'm a super\[Em]girl, and supergirls just \[C]fly
\endchorus

\beginverse
And then she'd ^say that nothing can go ^wrong
When you're in ^love, what can go ^wrong
And then she'd ^laugh the night time into ^day
Pushing her ^fear farther ^along
\endverse

\beginchorus\memorize
And then she'd \[G]say it's okay
I got \[D]lost on the way
But I'm a super\[Em]girl, and supergirls don't \[C]cry
And then she'd \[G]say its allright
I got \[D]home late last night
But I'm a super\[Em]girl, and supergirls just \[C]fly
\endchorus

\beginchorus
And then she'd ^shout down the line
Tell me she's ^got no more time
Cause she's a super^girl and supergirls don't ^cry
And then she'd ^scream in my face
Tell me to ^leave, leave this place, 
cause she's a super^girl and supergirls just ^fly
\endchorus

\beginverse
She's a super\[G]girl, a super\[D]girl
She's sowing \[Em]seeds    
She's burning trees
She's sowing \[C]seeds
She's burning \[(Em)]trees
She's a super\[G]girl, a Super\[D]girl
A super\[Em]girl, my super\[C]girl

I'm not sure about the verses, but the chorus should go: A, E, F#m, D. Try it, sounds much better.


Capo on second and its sounds good..And at the end you dont go C Emol .you just keep C and then G


Trying to simplify a more difficult version, I came to almost the same conclusion, using a capo on the 2nd fret and these chords:

Em 022000
Bm7 X20202
Am X02210
Cmaj7 X32000
G 320003
D XX0232
