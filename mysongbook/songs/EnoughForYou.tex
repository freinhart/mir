D         Bm              G
 You wore makeup when we dated
                            D
Cuz you thought I liked you more
              Bm             G
If you looked like the other prom queens
                    D
You thought I loved before
          Bm              G
Tried so hard to be everything that I like
      D         Bm               G___
Just for you to say I'm not the compliment type
D           Bm                 G
 And I knew how you took your coffee
                             D
And your favorite songs by heart
       Bm                G
I read all of your self-help books 
                           D
So you'd think that I was smart
          Bm          G
Stupid, emotional, obsessive little me
D                 Bm
 I knew from the start this is
 G
exactly how you'd leave
Chorus:
              D          Bm
You found someone more exciting
           G              D
The next second you were gone
D                       Bm
 And you left me there crying,
      G                D
wondering what I did wrong
                D               Bm
And you always say I'm never satisfied
       G                  D
But I don't think that's true
     D          Bm           G              D
Cuz all I ever wanted was to be enough for you
       D           Bm          G            D
Yeah, all I ever wanted was to be enough for you
D          Bm                G
 And maybe I'm just not as interesting
                     D
as the boys you had before
             Bm                  G
But God you couldn't have cared less about
                       D
Someone who loved you more
             Bm
I'd say you broke my heart
          G
But you broke much more than that
     D                   Bm
Now, I don't want your sympathy
        G
I just want myself back
Chorus: ...
     D          Bm           G
Cuz all I ever wanted was to be enough
           D                Bm
And don't you think I loved you too much
       G          D
To be used and discarded
           D                Bm
Don't you think I loved you too much
         G           D
To think I deserve nothing
     D                    Bm
But don't tell me you're sorry, girl
      G           D
Feel sorry for yourself
      D               Bm              G
Cuz someday, I'll be everything to somebody else
                       D        Bm
And they'll think that I am so exciting
G           D                 Bm
 And you'll be the one who's crying
G                  D              Bm
 Yeah, you always say I'm never satisfied
    G                     D
But I don't think that's true
     D              Bm
You say I'm never satisfied
     G                   D
But that's not me, it's you
     D           Bm          G
Cuz all I ever wanted was to be enough
    D               Bm            G
But I don't think anything could ever be enough
    D Bm G
For you
            D  Bm  G
Enough for you
                          D
No, nothing's enough for you
