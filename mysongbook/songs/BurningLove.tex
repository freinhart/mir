Intro: D
 
Verse 1:
D                G       A           D
Lord Almighty, I feel my temperature rising
D                  G            A             D
higher and higher, it's burning through to my soul
D                 G            A         D
Girl, girl, girl, you're gonna set me on fire
D                    G            A            D
My brain is flamin', I don't know which way to go
 
Chorus:
     Bm      A      G
Your kisses lift me higher
         Bm         A    G
Like the sweet song of a choir
    Bm       A       G
You light my morning sky
     A       D
With burning love
 
Verse 2:
D            G         A           D
Ooh hoo hoo, I feel my temperature rising
D                      G         A           D
Help me I'm flamin', I must be a hundred and nine
D                 G            A           D
Burnin', burnin', burnin', and nothing can cool me
D                      G          A      D
I just might turn into smoke, but I feel fine
 
Chorus
 
Solo (Chorus)
 
Verse 3:
D                       G              A          D
It's coming closer, the flames are now licking my body
D                    G             A         D
Won't you help me, I feel like I'm slipping away
D                        G        A       D
It's hard to breathe, my chest is a-heavin'
D                    G         A            D
Lord have mercy, I'm burning a hole where I lay

           D                   G
I'm just a hunka hunka burning love

Just a hunka hunka burning love
        D                   G
Just a hunka hunka burning love
(repeat and fade)
