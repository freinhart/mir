Strophe 1:
G               Bm     C            G
Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
    C                G      Em        A7           D7   G
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee,
G             Bm    C                 G
Little jackie paper loved that rascal Puff,
    C                       G       Em      A7    D7    G
And brought him strings and sealing wax and other fancy stuff.

Stophe 2:
G                   Bm          C                  G
Together they would travel on a boat with billowed sail
    C             G       Em         A7              D7
And Jackie kept a lookout perched on Puff's gigantic tail,
G               Bm            C                 G
Noble kings and princes would bow whenever they came,
C                  G           Em         A7          D7      G
Pirate ships would lower their flags when Puff roared out his name. oh

Chorus: (2x)
G               Bm     C            G
Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
    C                G      Em        A7               D7
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee,

Strophe 3:
  G            Bm          C             G
A dragon lives forever but not so little boys
C                 G     Em         A7            D7
Painted wings and giant rings make way for other toys.
G                 Bm               C             G
One grey night it happened, Jackie Paper came no more
    C                G       Em   A7           D7   G
And Puff that mighty dragon, he ceased his fearless roar.

Stophe 4:
    G                Bm            C                G
His head was bent in sorrow, green scales fell like rain,
C              G       Em   A7               D7
Puff no longer went to play along the cherry lane.
    G                 Bm      C                 G
Without his life-long friend, Puff could not be brave,
   C                G       Em A7               D7
So Puff that mighty dragon, he slipped into his cave. oh

Chorus:
G               Bm     C            G
Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
    C                G      Em        A7          G  C* G
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee.
