Intro: Am

Verse 1:
  C                Am
 Baby what have I done
F          C        G/B  Am
 Gone and left you all alone
  C                             Am
 It's hard for me to sing this song
F              C      G/B    Am
 We've been together for so long
F                     C         G/B    Am
 I think I know what my soul's got to say
F              C       G/B      Am
 And it won't hurt as bad, someday

Chorus:
                C  Am     G
 It's gonna be al-right, baby
                C  Am     G
 It's gonna be al-right, love
             C                      Am
 And if the mist ever lets the sun through
            G
 I'll just hope I did the right thing
             C
 For me and you

Verse 2:
  C                     Am
 Guess I'm ruled by my heart
F                  C         G/B  Am
 Built a life and I tore it all apart
  C                 Am
 It's just not our time
F                   C            G/B       Am
 But you'll find a new love and you'll be fine
F         C        G/B    Am
 So many dark and lonely nights
F                    C        G/B     Am
 But I believe some day I'll see the light
 
Chorus

Chorus:
               C  Am     G
It's gonna be al-right, baby
                C  Am     G
It's gonna be al-right, love
             C                      Am
And if the mist ever lets the sun through
            G
I'll just hope I did the right thing
             Am
For me and you
             C
For me and you
