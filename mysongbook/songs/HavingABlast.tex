Intro: A5   G5   (4x)

Verse 1:
    A5
I'm taking all you down with me
  F#5
Explosives duct taped to my spine
G5             E5
Nothings gonna change my mind
        A5
I won't listen to anyone's last words
        F#5
There's nothing left for you to say
G5                  E5
Soon you'll be dead anyway

Chorus:
D5                     A5
No one here is getting out alive
               B5
This time I've really lost my mind
            G5
and I don't care
   D5
So close your eyes
             A5
And kiss yourself goodbye
           B5
And think about the times you spent
                 G5
and what they've meant
           A5     G5    (4x)
To me it's nothing...

Verse 2:
    A5
I'm losing all my happiness
    F#5
The happiness you pinned on me
G5               E5
Loneliness still comforts me
   A5
My anger dwells inside of me
    F#5
I'm taking it all out on you
G5                   E5
And all the shit you put me through
 
Chorus

Bridge:
A5          F#5        B5         E5
Do you ever think back to another time?
A5                F#5
Does it bring you down that
D5          A5        E5
you thought you lost your mind?
 
Outro:
F#5         D5             A5
Do you ever want to lead a long trail of destruction
        F#5      G5               A5         G5 A5
and mow down any bullshit that confronts you?
F#5         D5               A5
Do you ever build up all the small things in your head?
        F#5         G5              A5     G5
To make one problem that adds up to nothing
           A5     G5   (3x)
To me it's nothing...
