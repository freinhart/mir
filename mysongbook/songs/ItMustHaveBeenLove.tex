Intro: C F (drums)

Verse 1:
       C
Lay a whisper on my pillow,
          F             G
leave the winter on the ground
          C                       F
I wake up lonely, there's air of silence
       Dm               G
in the bedroom and all around
         Am              C              F     G
Touch me now, I close my eyes and dream away

Chorus:
                  C                   F
It must have been love, but it's over now
                  Dm          Am          G
It must have been good, but I lost it somehow
                  C                  F
It must have been love but it's over now
                   Dm               Am           G
from the moment we touched till the time had run out

Verse 2:
       C
Make believing, we're together
         F                 G
that I'm sheltered by your heart
           C                      F
But in and outside I've turned to water
       Dm               G
like a teardrop in your palm
           Am             C            F    G
And it's a hard, winter's day, I dream away

Chorus:
It must have been love, but it's over now
It was all that I wanted, now I'm living without
It must have been love but it's over now
It's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows

It's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows

It must have been love but it's over now
