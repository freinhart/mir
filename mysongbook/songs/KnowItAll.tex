Intro: Dm F C A# F C

Verse 1:
C                 F               C
Well all I know is everything I've learned
                                A#          C
And if I'm changing that's the reason that I'll turn
   Am             G
Into someone I can trust
        F
Before I turn back into dust
          C            A#          C
There's an answer but I wouldn't be concerned
                      F                 C
Out of everything I've seen and all I've heard
                        A#               C
And everywhere I've been around the whole wide world
      Am                       G
There's still something I can't find
         F
I've been lost within my mind
         C              A#            C
Since you fell out of my sight without a word
 
Chorus:
      Am
Well I thought I knew it all
      F                C
Till I crashed into the wall
Dm                  F
Let me learn from my mistakes
                          C        A# F C
And try to pick up all the pieces

Verse 2:
C                    F             C
Well the night we met I thought you were the one
                       A#          C
Yes and when you left I nearly came undone
      Am                  G
There's a million miles to go
      F
At the end I still won't know
          C       A#              C
What I did to ever send you on the run
                          F                 C
Now the memories just keep flying 'round and 'round
                            A#            C
And I'm traveling faster than the speed of sound
       Am              G
Well the bigger I stand tall
        F
It's the harder I may fall
      C                A#        C
On the day my vices lay me in the ground

Verse 3:
C                 F               C
Well all I know is everything I've learned
                               A#           C
And if I'm changing that's the reason that I'll turn
   Am             G
Into someone I can trust
        F
Before I turn back into dust
          C            A#          C
There's an answer but I wouldn't be concerned

Chorus

Outro:
Dm                  F
Let me learn from my mistakes
                          C        A# F C
And try to pick up all the pieces
