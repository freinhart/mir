Intro: D  C  G
Verse 1:
       D  C                   G
It was 1989, my thoughts were short my hair was long
D                  C               G
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
D        C             G
She was 17 and she was far from in between
       D             C        G
It was summertime in Northern Michigan

Verse 2:
   D               C         G    
Splashin' thru the sandbar, talkin' by the campfire
          D                C                  G 
It's the simple things in life like when and where
    D             C             G
We didn't have no internet, but man I never will forget
    D                 C               G
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

Chorus:
            D                C                  G
And we were tryin' different things and we were smokin' funny things
       D               C                    G
Makin' love out by the lake to our favorite songs
        D              C          G
Sippin' whisky out the bottle not thinkin' 'bout tomorrow
        D             C        G            D  C  G
Singin' sweet home alabama all summer long
        D             C        G
Singin' sweet home alabama all summer long

Verse 3:
Catchin' walleye from the dock watchin' waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun we couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sandy place of rock 'n roll

Chorus
Solo
Verse 4:
Now nothin' seems as strange as when the leaves began to change
Oh how we thought those days would never end
Sometimes I hear that song and I'll start to sing along
And think man I'd like to see that girl again

Chorus (2x)
