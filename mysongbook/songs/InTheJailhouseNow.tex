I had a friend named Ramblin' Bob
          
He use-ta steal, gamble and rob
                                   E
He though he was the smartest guy around

But I found out last Monday, that Bob got locked up Sunday

Bob liked to play his poker 

Pinochle, Whist and Euchre (Pronounced Yoh-ker)
                                    E
But shooting dice was his favorite game

Well he got throwd in jail, with nobody to go his bail
     C#                                  F#
The judge done said that he refused the fine
