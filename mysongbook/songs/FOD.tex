Verse 1:
A 
Somethings on my mind 
A 
It's been for quite sometime 
     D        G     A 
This time I'm on to you 
A 
So where's the other face? 
A 
The face I heard before 
     D          G      A 
Your head trips boring me.

Chorus:
E               G         
 Let's nuke the bridge we torched  
D           A 
2.000 times before 
E               G                D    
This time we'll blast it all to hell 
E              G             D              A
I've had this burning in my guts now for so long 
E           G              D  
 My belly's aching now to say...

Verse 2: 
A 
Stuck down in a rut 
A 
of dislogic and smut 
   D       G       A   
a side of you well hid 
A 
When it's all said and done 
A 
It's real and it's been fun 
    D      G        A  
but was it all real fun?

Chorus 

Bridge:
D       A    D  A
You're just  a fuck
D   A
I can't explain it
       G           A
'cause I think you suck
D     A    D  A
I'm taking pride
D     A
I'm telling you
        G       A
to fuck off and die

Chorus:
I've had this burning in my guts now for so long 
My belly's aching now to say...
I've taken pleasure in the masochistic youth
so listen up cause you might miss...
