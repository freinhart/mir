Intro: G - Em - G - Em

Verse 1:
   G                Em
I heard there was a secret chord
     G                   Em
that David played and it pleased the lord
    C                D                  G   D
but you don't really care for music, do you
     G                     C           D
well it goes like this the fourth, the fifth
    Em                 C
the minor fall and the major lift
    D                B7         Em
the baffled king composing hallelujah

Chorus:
     C            Em
Hallelujah,  hallelujah,
     C           G  D  G   Em   G   Em
hallelujah, hallelu___jah.

Verse 2:
     G                        Em
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
    G               Em
you saw her bathing on the roof
    C              D                    G   D
her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
    G               C       D
she tied you to her kitchen chair
    Em                        C
she broke your throne and she cut your hair
    D                  B7           Em
and from your lips she drew the hallelujah

Chorus









Verse 3:
G               Em
Baby I've been here before
     G                       Em
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
  C             D                   G    D
I used to live alone before I knew you
     G                     C       D
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
    Em             C
but love is not a victory march
       D               B7          Em
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Chorus

Verse 4:
      G                   Em
There was a time when you let me know
       G            Em
what's really going on below
    C             D                   G    D
but now you never show that to me do you
      G             C          D
but remember when i moved in you
        Em            C
and the holy dove was moving too
    D                B7          Em
and every breath we drew was hallelujah

Verse 5:
G               Em
Maybe there's a god above
    G             Em
but all I've ever learned from love
    C            D                       G  D
was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
     G                  C       D
it's not a cry that you hear at night
     Em                  C
it's not somebody who's seen the light
       D               B7         Em
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
