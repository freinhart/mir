Verse 1:
G                    F
My mama told me when I was young
C                    G 
We are all born superstars
G                      F
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
C                      G 
In the glass of her boudoir
G                           F
There's nothin' wrong with lovin' who you are
C           G 
She said 'Cause he made you perfect, babe
G                      F
So hold your head up, girl & you you'll go far,
C                    G

Interlude (N.C.): Don't be a drag, just be a queen

Verse 2:
Give yourself prudence
And love your friends
Subway kid, rejoice your truth
In the religion of the insecure
I must be myself, respect my youth
A different lover is not a sin
Believe capital H-I-M (Hey, Hey, Hey)
I love my life, I love this record and
Mi amore vole fe yah (Love needs faith)

Chorus
Bridge
Interlude

Bridge 2:
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Whether you're broke or evergreen
You're black, white, beige, chola descent
You're lebanese, you're orient
Whether life's disabilities
Left you outcast, bullied or teased
Rejoice and love yourself today
'Cause baby, you were Born This Way

No matter gay, straight or bi
Lesbian, transgendered life
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born to survive
No matter black, white or beige
Chola or orient made
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born to be brave

Chorus

Outro (2x):
      G 
I was Born This Way, hey!
      F
I was Born This Way, hey!
           C
I'm on the right track, baby
      G 
I was Born This Way, hey!
