Thanks to hannah_bobana for the intro riff!

verse

C                     Em             
There's no combination of words
         Am                      G
I could put on the back of a postcard
F              C/E
No song that I could sing
       Dm            G
But I can try for your heart,
C       Em                Am                 G 
our dreams, and they are made out of real things
        F               C/E
like a shoe box of photographs
          Dm         G
with sepia-toned loving
C              Em
Love is the answer
              Am                        G
at least for most of the questions in my heart, like
F             C/E                 Dm 
Why are we here? And where do we go?
                   G
And how come it's so hard?
C                 Em
It's not always easy and
            Am               G
sometimes life can be deceiving
F                    C/E               Am                   G
I'll tell you one thing, it's always better when we're together


chorus
F                   G
Mmmm, It's always better when we're together
F                       G
Yeah we'll look at the stars and we're together
F                   G
Well, it's always better when we're together
F               G
Yeah so much better when we're together


C Em Am G F C/E Dm G
C Em Am G F C/E Dm G 



same as verse 1

And all of these moments
just might find their way into my dreams tonight,
But I know that they’ll be gone
when the morning light sings
and brings new things
for tomorrow night you see
that they’ll be gone too,
too many things I have to do
But if all of these dreams might find their way
into my day to day scene
I'd be under the impression
i was somewhere in between
With only two,
Just me and you,
Not so many things we got to do
or places we got to be
We'll sit beneath the mango tree, now,


chorus (same as before)
F                   G
Mmmm, It's always better when we're together
F                       G
Yeah we'll look at the stars and we're together
F                   G
Well, it's always better when we're together
F               G
Yeah so much better when we're together


C Em Am G F Em Dm G 
C Em Am G F Em Dm G 


Dm                 G
I believe in memories
              Dm                  G
they look so, so pretty when I sleep
         Dm               G 
Hey now, and when I wake up,
            Dm                       G
you look so pretty sleeping next to me

              F             G
But there is not enough time,
               F                G
There is no, no song I could sing
                 Dm               G
and there is no combination of words I could say
              F                  G
but I will still tell you one thing

We're Better together
