VERSE 1:
N.C.        A  D         A  D          A
For I have got  another girl  another girl
                  G               A            D    A
You're making me say that I've got nobody but you
             G                   A                 D
But as from today, well, I've got somebody that's new
                                               E
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want

VERSE 2:
             A D          A   D         A
For I have got   another girl  another girl
                    G                A               D     A
She's sweeter than all the girls and  I met quite a few
           G                A                D
Nobody in all the world can  do what she can do
                                                  E
And so I'm telling you, "This time you'd better stop"

CHORUS:
           A   D        A        D
For I have got  another girl
         C             G                C      G
Another girl who will love me till the end
                   C              G            A7
Through thick and thin she will always be my friend

VERSE 3:
A                G                 A               D   A
 I don't want to say that I've been  unhappy with you
                G                  A                 D
But, as from today, well, I've seen somebody that's new
                                               E
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want

Another girl, another girl...
