Verse 1 (note that this is the only verse):

	Am                  G
	As I walk along I wonder what went wrong
	      F                             E
	With our love, a love that was so strong
        Am                         G
	And as I still walk on, I think of the things we've done
	   F                              E	
	Together, while our hearts were young

Chorus:

	 A
	I'm a walkin' in the rain
	 F#m
	Tears are fallin' and I feel the pain
	 A
	Wishin' you were here by me
	F#m
	To end this misery
	       A
	And I wonder
	              F#m
	I wa-wa-wa-wa-wonder
	 A
	Why
	                   F#m
	Ah-why-why-why-why-why she ran away
	       D                     E
	And I wonder where she will stay
	           A        D               A      [1, 2: E;  3: to coda]
	My little runaway, run-run-run-run-runaway
