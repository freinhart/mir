Lyrics

Early in the mornin' ,risin' to the street
Light me up that cigarette and i strap shoes on my feet
got to find a reason, a reason things went wrong
got to find a reason why the money's all gone
but i got a dalmation and i can still get high
i can play the guitar like a mother***in' riot.

Life is (too short) so love the one you got
cause you might get run over or you might get shot
never start no static i just get it off my chest
never had to battle with no bulletproof vest
take a small example a tip from me
take all of your money , give it up to charity
lovin's what i got it within reach
sublime style's still straight from long beach
it all comes back to you you're gonna get what you deserve
try and test htat you're bound to get served
love's what i got don't starta riot
you feel it when the dance gets hot

Chorus
Lovin..is what i got said remember that

I don't cry when my dog runs away
i don't get angry at the bills i have to pay
i don't get angry when my mom smokes pot
hits the bottle and goes back to the rock
***in' and fightin' it's all the same
livin' with louie dog's the only way to stay sane
let the lovin come back to me.
