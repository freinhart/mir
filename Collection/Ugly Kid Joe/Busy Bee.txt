From: Glen Norman Pavan 

artist:  Ugly Kid Joe
title:  "Busy Bee"
album:  America's Least Wanted
key:  E/c#

tuning:  ha ha ha...  now I'm well aware that when ppl try and tab for a 
band who tune down their guitars, they still call the 3rd fret for 
example on a string tuned Eb as being G and not the note they're playing, 
Gb.  Well, as it is one of my biggest pet peeves, I've decided that I'm 
going to depict the note played, and you can decide on how you want to 
tune your instrument.  Bear in mind, this song incorporates 
the Eb HEAVILY...  so, tune down, or move up 11/12 of an octave  :)

intro:

        Everybody's alright with me   (Eb)
        Possibly you'll disagree  (Ab)
        (Eb)      (Bb)     
        (Ab) Busy bee watch the world go by

verse:

     (Eb) Everybody's alright with me
     (Eb) Cause that's the way I choose to be (Ab)
     (Eb) Everybody's on my mind
     (Bb) Can't sit aside and watch this 
     (Ab)world go by, that ain't me.

chorus:

     (Eb)     (Bb)      
     (Ab) Busy bee watch the world go by
     (Eb)      (Bb)
     (Ab) Busy be  watch the world go by
     (Eb)  Yeah (Bb)  (Ab)

second verse:
     
     Now everybody does their time
     Those people walk in crooked lines
     Everybody's got their choice
     But often, we don't use our voice

repeat chorus

bridge:
   
     (Ab)Yeah, busy bee watch the world (Bb) go by 
     (Ab) How could you be (C) so (Ab)blind
     (Bb) some people they just (Ab) ain't satisfied
     (Eb)     (Bb)      (Ab)    (Eb)  (Bb)   (Ab)
 
repeat bridge during guitar solo
 
third verse:
     
     I always hear the schoolbell ring
     Let the children dance and sing
     Just let us find what's been lost
     So many people get turned and tossed away

repeat chorus

second guitar solo:
    
      (Eb)     (Bb)     (Ab)     repeat 3 times

outro:

 (Bb)World goes (Ab)by        repeat twice
 (Eb)Watch the (Bb)world go (Ab)by   repeat 3 times    
     

well, there you go...   questions, comments, feedback are well appreciated

and, yes, I am too lazy to just tune down half a step!  :)
