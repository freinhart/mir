INTRO:  G    C  G   C

G         C       G
LOVE IS A BURNING THING
               C      G
AND IT MAKES A FIRERY RING
         C    G
BOUND BY WILD DESIRE
              C       G
I FELL INTO A RING OF FIRE

CHORUS:
D             C               G
I FELL INTO A BURNING RING OF FIRE 
       D
I WENT DOWN, DOWN, DOWN
        C           G
AND THE FLAMES WENT HIGHER

AND IT BURNS, BURNS, BURNS
    C       G
THE RING OF FIRE 
    C       G
THE RING OF FIRE

REPEAT INTRO TWICE
REPEAT CHORUS

             C       G
THE TASTE OF LOVE IS SWEET
                 C    G
WHEN HEARTS LIKE OURS MEET
               C      G
I FELL FOR YOU LIKE A CHILD
             C         G
OHH, BUT THE FIRE WENT WILD

REPEAT CHORUS 2x's

AND IT BURNS, BURNS, BURNS
    C       G
THE RING OF FIRE
    G       G
THE RING OF FIRE
